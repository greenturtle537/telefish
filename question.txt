Mev: What are the key game mechanics of Webfishing? List below
there's a mix of ones i actually use and ones i do not but are still there
catch fish (big variety) -> fish vary is type, size, and then shiny level (ex. a normal 1cm shrimp or a "radiant" whale of 3000 cm)
sell fish (different type and size and shiny level sell for different amounts)
buy upgrades to catch better and stronger fish (your strength, how fast you reel, how quickly you get a bite, luck chance of getting extra stuff)
customize appearance (not very applicable, maybe change color idk)
there's a hut with a guy who sells lottery tickets
metal detecting (usually a coin or soda tab or smth, sometimes better stuff like a sword shard which combines into a full sword at the hut person)
talk to other people/socialize
there is chalk to draw and music instruments
a few neat places like a lighthouse and an aquarium where you can store one fish and only one fish
if you fall in the water you drown and respawn outside of the water (basically) (i exaggerate)
a few secret hidden goodies like bones which combine into a cool new fishing rod
there are emotes
thingies called "fishing buddies" which catch fish for you (passive fish income) which can be upgraded to catch better fish and catch faster

main minigame for fishing -> when you get a bite, you hold down mouseclick to reel in, and mash mouse at sections to get rid of a wall
(stronger fish set higher and more walls, strength impacts how much you need to mash) and then you got the fish and hold it up and it gives a
little bit of flavor text like animal crossing

that's all i can think of rn
